# Kuka Reacher Reinforcement Learning Sim2Real Environment for Omniverse Isaac Gym/Sim

This repository adds a KukaReacher environment based on [OmniIsaacGymEnvs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs) (commit [cc1aab0](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/tree/cc1aab0f904ade860fc0761d62edb6e706ab89ec)), and plan to include Sim2Real code to control a real-world [Kuka](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots) with the policy learned by reinforcement learning in Omniverse Isaac Gym/Sim.

The RL code in this branch is only tested on Linux using Isaac Sim 2023.1.0. The Sim2Real code isn't implemented yet.

This repo is compatible with the following repositories:
- [OmniIsaacGymEnvs-DofbotReacher](https://github.com/j3soon/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-DofbotReacher)
- [OmniIsaacGymEnvs-UR10Reacher](https://github.com/j3soon/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-UR10Reacher)

     cd $ISAAC_SIM
     conda activate isaac-sim
     source setup_conda_env.sh
     ```
   - Windows
     ```sh
     set ROBOT_NAME="KukaKR120R2500Pro"
     set ROBOT_NAME_LOWER="kukakr120r2500pro"
     set ISAAC_SIM="%LOCALAPPDATA%\ov\pkg\isaac_sim-2023.1.0"
     cd %ISAAC_SIM%
     conda activate isaac-sim
     call setup_conda_env.bat
     ```

Please note that you should execute the commands in Step 6 for every new shell.

For Windows users, replace `~` to `%USERPROFILE%` for all the following commands.

## Dummy Policy

This is a sample to make sure you have setup the environment correctly. You should see a single Kuka in Isaac Sim.

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/dummy_${ROBOT_NAME_LOWER}_policy.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher test=True num_envs=1
```

Alternatively, you can replace the dummy policy with a random policy with `omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/random_policy.py`.

## Training

You can launch the training in `headless` mode as follows:

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/rlgames_train.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher headless=True
```

The number of environments is set to 2048 by default. If your GPU has small memory, you can decrease the number of environments by changing the arguments `num_envs` as below:

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/rlgames_train.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher headless=True num_envs=2048
```

You can also skip training by downloading the pre-trained model checkpoint by:

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
wget https://github.com/j3soon/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher/releases/download/v1.0.0/runs.zip
unzip runs.zip
```

The learning curve of the pre-trained model:

![](docs/media/KukaKR120R2500ProReacher-Learning-Curve.png)  
(KukaKR120R2500Pro)

## Testing

Make sure you have stored the model checkpoints at `~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher/runs`, you can check it with the following command:

```sh
ls ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher/runs/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher/nn/
```

In order to achieve the highest rewards, you may not want to use the latest checkpoint `./runs/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher/nn/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher.pth`. Instead, use the checkpoint with highest rewards such as `./runs/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher/nn/last_${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher_ep_1000_rew_XXX.pth`. You can replace `${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher.pth` with the latest checkpoint before following the steps below, or simply modify the commands below to use the latest checkpoint.

You can visualize the learned policy by the following command:

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/rlgames_train.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher test=True num_envs=512 checkpoint=./runs/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher/nn/${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher.pth
```

Likewise, you can decrease the number of environments by modifying the parameter `num_envs=512`.

## Sim2Real

> (To be updated)

## Demo

We provide an interactable demo based on the `${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher` RL example. In this demo, you can click on any of
the Kuka in the scene to manually control the robot with your keyboard as follows:

- `Q`/`A`: Control Joint 0.
- `W`/`S`: Control Joint 1.
- `E`/`D`: Control Joint 2.
- `R`/`F`: Control Joint 3.
- `T`/`G`: Control Joint 4.
- `Y`/`H`: Control Joint 5.
- `ESC`: Unselect a selected Kuka and yields manual control

Launch this demo with the following command. Note that this demo limits the maximum number of Kuka in the scene to 128.

```sh
cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/rlgames_demo.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher num_envs=64
```

## Running in Docker

If you have a [NVIDIA Enterprise subscription](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_nucleus/prod_nucleus/enterprise/installation/planning.html), you can run all services with Docker Compose.

For users without a subscription, you can pull the [Isaac Docker image](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/isaac-sim), but should still install Omniverse Nucleus beforehand. (only Isaac itself is dockerized)

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_container.html#isaac-sim-setup-remote-headless-container) to generate your NGC API Key.

Please note that you should clone this repositories in your home directory and generate instanceable assets beforehand as mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.

We will now set up the docker environment.

1. Build the docker image
   ```sh
   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2023.1.0-hotfix.1
   docker build . -t j3soon/isaac-sim
   ```
2. Launch an Isaac Container in Headless mode:
   ```sh
   scripts/run_docker_headless.sh
   ./runheadless.native.sh
   ```
   Alternatively, launch an Isaac Container with GUI (The host machine should include a desktop environment):
   ```sh
   scripts/run_docker.sh
   ./runapp.sh
   ```
3. Install this repository
   ```sh
   cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. Run any command in the docker container

   > Make sure to add `headless=True` if the container is launched in headless mode.

   For an example, running the training script:

   ```sh
   cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
   python omniisaacgymenvs/scripts/rlgames_train.py task=${ROBOT_NAME}Reacher headless=True num_envs=2048
   ```

   You can watch the training progress with:

   ```sh
   docker exec -it isaac-sim /bin/bash
   cd ~/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-KukaReacher
   tensorboard --logdir=./runs
   ```

# Omniverse Isaac Gym Reinforcement Learning Environments for Isaac Sim

## About this repository

This repository contains Reinforcement Learning examples that can be run with the latest release of [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). RL examples are trained using PPO from [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) library and examples are built on top of Isaac Sim's `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` frameworks.

Please see [release notes](docs/release_notes.md) for the latest updates.

## Installation

Follow the Isaac Sim [documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html) to install the latest Isaac Sim release. 

*Examples in this repository rely on features from the most recent Isaac Sim release. Please make sure to update any existing Isaac Sim build to the latest release version, 2023.1.0, to ensure examples work as expected.*

Note that the 2022.2.1 OmniIsaacGymEnvs release will no longer work with the latest Isaac Sim 2023.1.0 release. Due to a change in USD APIs, line 138 in rl_task.py is no longer valid. To run the previous OIGE release with the latest Isaac Sim release, please comment out lines 137 and 138 in rl_task.py or set `add_distant_light` to `False` in the task config file. No changes are required if running with the latest release of OmniIsaacGymEnvs.

Once installed, this repository can be used as a python module, `omniisaacgymenvs`, with the python executable provided in Isaac Sim.

To install `omniisaacgymenvs`, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs.git
```

Once cloned, locate the [python executable in Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_python.html). By default, this should be `python.sh`. We will refer to this path as `PYTHON_PATH`.

To set a `PYTHON_PATH` variable in the terminal that links to the python executable, we can run a command that resembles the following. Make sure to update the paths to your local path.

```
For Linux: alias PYTHON_PATH=~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-*/python.sh
For Windows: doskey PYTHON_PATH=C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\ov\pkg\isaac_sim-*\python.bat $*
For IsaacSim Docker: alias PYTHON_PATH=/isaac-sim/python.sh
```

Install `omniisaacgymenvs` as a python module for `PYTHON_PATH`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -e .
```

The following error may appear during the initial installation. This error is harmless and can be ignored.

```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
```


### Running the examples

*Note: All commands should be executed from `OmniIsaacGymEnvs/omniisaacgymenvs`.*

To train your first policy, run:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Cartpole
```

An Isaac Sim app window should be launched. Once Isaac Sim initialization completes, the Cartpole scene will be constructed and simulation will start running automatically. The process will terminate once training finishes.

Note that by default, we show a Viewport window with rendering, which slows down training. You can choose to close the Viewport window during training for better performance. The Viewport window can be re-enabled by selecting `Window > Viewport` from the top menu bar.

To achieve maximum performance, launch training in `headless` mode as follows:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant headless=True
```

#### A Note on the Startup Time of the Simulation

Some of the examples could take a few minutes to load because the startup time scales based on the number of environments. The startup time will continually
be optimized in future releases.

### Extension Workflow

The extension workflow provides a simple user interface for creating and launching RL tasks. To launch Isaac Sim for the extension workflow, run:

```bash
./<isaac_sim_root>/isaac-sim.gym.sh --ext-folder </parent/directory/to/OIGE>
```

Note: `isaac_sim_root` should be located in the same directory as `python.sh`.

The UI window can be activated from `Isaac Examples > RL Examples` by navigating the top menu bar.
For more details on the extension workflow, please refer to the [documentation](docs/extension_workflow.md).

### Loading trained models // Checkpoints

Checkpoints are saved in the folder `runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/nn` where `EXPERIMENT_NAME`
defaults to the task name, but can also be overridden via the `experiment` argument.

To load a trained checkpoint and continue training, use the `checkpoint` argument:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth
```

To load a trained checkpoint and only perform inference (no training), pass `test=True`
as an argument, along with the checkpoint name. To avoid rendering overhead, you may
also want to run with fewer environments using `num_envs=64`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Note that if there are special characters such as `[` or `=` in the checkpoint names,
you will need to escape them and put quotes around the string. For example,
`checkpoint="runs/Ant/nn/last_Antep\=501rew\[5981.31\].pth"`

We provide pre-trained checkpoints on the [Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/index.html) server under `Assets/Isaac/2023.1.0/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints`. Run the following command
to launch inference with pre-trained checkpoint:

Localhost (To set up localhost, please refer to the [Isaac Sim installation guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html)):

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=omniverse://localhost/NVIDIA/Assets/Isaac/2023.1.0/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Production server:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=http://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/2023.1.0/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

When running with a pre-trained checkpoint for the first time, we will automatically download the checkpoint file to `omniisaacgymenvs/checkpoints`. For subsequent runs, we will re-use the file that has already been downloaded, and will not overwrite existing checkpoints with the same name in the `checkpoints` folder.

## Runing from Docker

Latest Isaac Sim Docker image can be found on [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/isaac-sim). A utility script is provided at `docker/run_docker.sh` to help initialize this repository and launch the Isaac Sim docker container. The script can be run with:

```bash
./docker/run_docker.sh
```

Then, training can be launched from the container with:

```bash
/isaac-sim/python.sh scripts/rlgames_train.py headless=True task=Ant
```

To run the Isaac Sim docker with UI, use the following script:

```bash
./docker/run_docker_viewer.sh
```

Then, training can be launched from the container with:

```bash
/isaac-sim/python.sh scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant
```

To avoid re-installing OIGE each time a container is launched, we also provide a dockerfile that can be used to build an image with OIGE installed. To build the image, run:

```bash
docker build -t isaac-sim-oige -f docker/dockerfile .
```

Then, start a container with the built image:

```bash
./docker/run_dockerfile.sh
```

Then, training can be launched from the container with:

```bash
/isaac-sim/python.sh scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant headless=True
```

## Livestream

OmniIsaacGymEnvs supports livestream through the [Omniverse Streaming Client](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_streaming-client/app_streaming-client/overview.html). To enable this feature, add the commandline argument `enable_livestream=True`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant headless=True enable_livestream=True
```

Connect from the Omniverse Streaming Client once the SimulationApp has been created. Note that enabling livestream is equivalent to training with the viewer enabled, thus the speed of training/inferencing will decrease compared to running in headless mode.


## Training Scripts

All scripts provided in `omniisaacgymenvs/scripts` can be launched directly with `PYTHON_PATH`.

To test out a task without RL in the loop, run the random policy script with:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/random_policy.py task=Cartpole
```

This script will sample random actions from the action space and apply these actions to your task without running any RL policies. Simulation should start automatically after launching the script, and will run indefinitely until terminated.


To run a simple form of PPO from `rl_games`, use the single-threaded training script:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Cartpole
```

This script creates an instance of the PPO runner in `rl_games` and automatically launches training and simulation. Once training completes (the total number of iterations have been reached), the script will exit. If running inference with `test=True checkpoint=<path/to/checkpoint>`, the script will run indefinitely until terminated. Note that this script will have limitations on interaction with the UI.


### Configuration and command line arguments

We use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to manage the config.

Common arguments for the training scripts are:

* `task=TASK` - Selects which task to use. Any of `AllegroHand`, `Ant`, `Anymal`, `AnymalTerrain`, `BallBalance`, `Cartpole`, `CartpoleCamera`, `Crazyflie`, `FactoryTaskNutBoltPick`, `FactoryTaskNutBoltPlace`, `FactoryTaskNutBoltScrew`, `FrankaCabinet`, `FrankaDeformable`, `Humanoid`, `Ingenuity`, `Quadcopter`, `ShadowHand`, `ShadowHandOpenAI_FF`, `ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTM` (these correspond to the config for each environment in the folder `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task`)
* `train=TRAIN` - Selects which training config to use. Will automatically default to the correct config for the environment (ie. `<TASK>PPO`).
* `num_envs=NUM_ENVS` - Selects the number of environments to use (overriding the default number of environments set in the task config).
* `seed=SEED` - Sets a seed value for randomization, and overrides the default seed in the task config
* `pipeline=PIPELINE` - Which API pipeline to use. Defaults to `gpu`, can also set to `cpu`. When using the `gpu` pipeline, all data stays on the GPU. When using the `cpu` pipeline, simulation can run on either CPU or GPU, depending on the `sim_device` setting, but a copy of the data is always made on the CPU at every step.
* `sim_device=SIM_DEVICE` - Device used for physics simulation. Set to `gpu` (default) to use GPU and to `cpu` for CPU.
* `device_id=DEVICE_ID` - Device ID for GPU to use for simulation and task. Defaults to `0`. This parameter will only be used if simulation runs on GPU.
* `rl_device=RL_DEVICE` - Which device / ID to use for the RL algorithm. Defaults to `cuda:0`, and follows PyTorch-like device syntax.
* `multi_gpu=MULTI_GPU` - Whether to train using multiple GPUs. Defaults to `False`. Note that this option is only available with `rlgames_train.py`.
* `test=TEST`- If set to `True`, only runs inference on the policy and does not do any training.
* `checkpoint=CHECKPOINT_PATH` - Path to the checkpoint to load for training or testing.
* `headless=HEADLESS` - Whether to run in headless mode.
* `enable_livestream=ENABLE_LIVESTREAM` - Whether to enable Omniverse streaming.
* `experiment=EXPERIMENT` - Sets the name of the experiment.
* `max_iterations=MAX_ITERATIONS` - Sets how many iterations to run for. Reasonable defaults are provided for the provided environments.
* `warp=WARP` - If set to True, launch the task implemented with Warp backend (Note: not all tasks have a Warp implementation).
* `kit_app=KIT_APP` - Specifies the absolute path to the kit app file to be used.

Hydra also allows setting variables inside config files directly as command line arguments. As an example, to set the minibatch size for a rl_games training run, you can use `train.params.config.minibatch_size=64`. Similarly, variables in task configs can also be set. For example, `task.env.episodeLength=100`.

#### Hydra Notes

Default values for each of these are found in the `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/config.yaml` file.

The way that the `task` and `train` portions of the config works are through the use of config groups.
You can learn more about how these work [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/config_groups/)
The actual configs for `task` are in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task/<TASK>.yaml` and for `train` in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/train/<TASK>PPO.yaml`.

In some places in the config you will find other variables referenced (for example,
 `num_actors: ${....task.env.numEnvs}`). Each `.` represents going one level up in the config hierarchy.
 This is documented fully [here](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#variable-interpolation).

### Tensorboard

Tensorboard can be launched during training via the following command:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m tensorboard.main --logdir runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/summaries
```

## WandB support

You can run (WandB)[https://wandb.ai/] with OmniIsaacGymEnvs by setting `wandb_activate=True` flag from the command line. You can set the group, name, entity, and project for the run by setting the `wandb_group`, `wandb_name`, `wandb_entity` and `wandb_project` arguments. Make sure you have WandB installed in the Isaac Sim Python executable with `PYTHON_PATH -m pip install wandb` before activating.


## Training with Multiple GPUs

To train with multiple GPUs, use the following command, where `--proc_per_node` represents the number of available GPUs:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m torch.distributed.run --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/rlgames_train.py headless=True task=Ant multi_gpu=True
```

## Multi-Node Training

To train across multiple nodes/machines, it is required to launch an individual process on each node.
For the master node, use the following command, where `--proc_per_node` represents the number of available GPUs, and `--nnodes` represents the number of nodes:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=2 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --rdzv_id=123 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:5555 scripts/rlgames_train.py headless=True task=Ant multi_gpu=True
```

Note that the port (`5555`) can be replaced with any other available port.

For non-master nodes, use the following command, replacing `--node_rank` with the index of each machine:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=2 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --rdzv_id=123 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=ip_of_master_machine:5555 scripts/rlgames_train.py headless=True task=Ant multi_gpu=True
```

For more details on multi-node training with PyTorch, please visit [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_series_multinode.html). As mentioned in the PyTorch documentation, "multinode training is bottlenecked by inter-node communication latencies". When this latency is high, it is possible multi-node training will perform worse than running on a single node instance.

## Tasks

Source code for tasks can be found in `omniisaacgymenvs/tasks`.

Each task follows the frameworks provided in `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` in Isaac Sim.

Refer to [docs/framework.md](docs/framework.md) for how to create your own tasks.

Full details on each of the tasks available can be found in the [RL examples documentation](docs/rl_examples.md).


## Demo

We provide an interactable demo based on the `AnymalTerrain` RL example. In this demo, you can click on any of
the ANYmals in the scene to go into third-person mode and manually control the robot with your keyboard as follows:

- `Up Arrow`: Forward linear velocity command
- `Down Arrow`: Backward linear velocity command
- `Left Arrow`: Leftward linear velocity command
- `Right Arrow`: Rightward linear velocity command
- `Z`: Counterclockwise yaw angular velocity command
- `X`: Clockwise yaw angular velocity command
- `C`: Toggles camera view between third-person and scene view while maintaining manual control
- `ESC`: Unselect a selected ANYmal and yields manual control

Launch this demo with the following command. Note that this demo limits the maximum number of ANYmals in the scene to 128.

```
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_demo.py task=AnymalTerrain num_envs=64 checkpoint=omniverse://localhost/NVIDIA/Assets/Isaac/2023.1.0/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/anymal_terrain.pth 
```
